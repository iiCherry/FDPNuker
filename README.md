# FDPNuker

### What is this?
This is a setup executable that nukes the user's FDPClient installation folder upon being run.


### How does this work?
This executable is disguised as an "installer" for FDPClient, and once the user completes the "installation", the setup will override all of the files in ``%appdata%\.minecraft\FDPClient-1.8`` directory with some funny stuff.

### Is this harmful?
No, it simply nukes the ``FDPClient-1.8`` folder and that's it. No harm is done to the machine that runs this.

## To do the funny:
Send an FDP user the fake "`UnIegitMC/FDPClient`" repo where the "L" in UnlegitMC is replaced with an I

This repo is basically an exact replica of the original FDPClient repo and it's very likely that FDP users will fall for this because the average FDP user has less than 1 iq
