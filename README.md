# FDPNuker

### What is this?
This is a setup executable that nukes the user's FDPClient installation folder upon being run.


### How does this work?
This executable is disguised as an "installer" for FDPClient, and once the user completes the "installation", the setup will override all of the files in ``%appdata%\.minecraft\FDPClient-1.8`` directory with some funny stuff.

### Is this harmful?
No, it simply nukes the ``FDPClient-1.8`` folder and that's it. No harm is done to the machine that runs this.
